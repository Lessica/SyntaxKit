//  A datastructure that facilitates working with strings that have nested
//  scopes associated with them. A scope being a named range that can have an
//  attribute assciated with it for the callers convenience.
//  The ranges can be nested. The datastructure could be visualized like this:
//  In fact, something like this is returned by the prettyPrint function.
//
//  Top:                              ----
//                              -------------
//            -------   -----------------------------
//  Bottom:  ------------------------------------------
//  String: "(This is) (string (with (nest)ed) scopes)!"
//
//  Note:
//  In the picture above the parens are not actually in the string, they serve
//  visualization purposes. The bottom-most layer is implicit and is not stored.
//  A new layer is added if no layer can hold the inserted scope without
//  creating intersections.
//
//  In the future the datastructure could be optimized by using binary search
//  for insertions at the individual levels.
